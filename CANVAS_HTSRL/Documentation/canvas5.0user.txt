This is documentation for CANVAS 5.0 Users

First of all. Welcome to CANVAS! We, the CANVAS team, hope you'll find CANVAS
extremely useful, and even perhaps fun to use. Remember, like all complex tools,
CANVAS is something you'll want to try in a controlled environment, like a lab, first, 
before attempting something complex in the real world. That said, CANVAS is remarkably
easy to use once you get the hang of it. This document should help, but feel free
to ask questions of the team at admin@immunityinc.com if you get confused.

Quickstart notes:

This section is for those people who don't like to read documentation. You'll
want to test CANVAS on a testbox to get a feel for it first. Here's what I'd do:

Install a Windows 2000 SP 4 box somewhere. Get it's IP. Then boot CANVAS's
GUI. The most important window here is the Node Tree. Go into the node tree,
expand it until you see "Known Hosts" and add a host with the IP that you
specified. Then go down to "Interfaces" and right click on the interface that
you want to get callbacks on. Make this your default callback. If you're on
Linux, this is probably eth0. On Windows, it's probably Local Ethernet
Adaptor. One exception is if you're using VMWare and the VMWare machine is set
up to do host-only or NAT networking. 

Once you have your callback and target set, choose the lsass exploit from the
left window pane, and fire away. Some things should scroll by, and then a
Shell Window will pop up. Click the getpwd (and wait a bit - MOSDEF is slow
the first time). Click it again to get your directory a second time (quickly,
since it's cached).

Running a command will be slow the first time as well. After that, try some of
the utilities in the Command pane. Screenshot is probably the most fun, but
pwdump can be useful as well. You can view your screenshots at any time using
pretty icon in the menubar. If you get an all black "Screenshot" that means that
the user you broke into did not have the privileges needed to take a screenshot.

GUI Usage Notes:

FAQ:
This is a list of commonly asked questions about the CANVAS GUI.

Q: Why can't I edit the hosts field in the exploit dialog box?
A: The Host field in the dialog is filled in automatically by the CANVAS GUI. If you 
want to change the target, add a new target using the right mouse button under 
"known hosts" (or via one of the other modules, such as addfromfile), and select
it with the right mouse button.


Integration with other tools

FAQ

Q. Is there any way to use CANVAS to bounce through another host when my
initial exploitation was not through CANVAS?

A. At some point we'll have a "cmd.exe to MOSDEF" module, but for now, the
best way is to use testvuln1.exe (listens on a socket) or testvuln3.exe (calls
back) to connect to CANVAS. Of course, you can always do this through some
other tool, such as Hydrogen. At some point we'll find a way to let you steal the
socket descriptor from another tool as well.
