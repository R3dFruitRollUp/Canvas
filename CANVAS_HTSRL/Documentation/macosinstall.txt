# NOTE:
# If you install python before, or install the ports in different order and the GUI 
# is not working for you, try uninstalll all the port and install it in the right order


[o] Install XcodeTools:
        -> Sometimes, the installer is on your HD already:
	 Applications->Installers->Xcode Tools->XcodeTools.mpkg
        -> Or find it on the Tiger DVD
        -> Or download it from apple.com website

           
[o] Download and install Darwinports :

	http://www.darwinports.org/getdp/
	The usual: ./configure && make && sudo make install
	once they are installed:
	(change PATH to /opt/local/bin)

	If you are behind an http_proxy, you would probably need:
	$ sudo -s
	# export RSYNC_PROXY=192.168.1.1:3128
	# export ftp_proxy=192.168.1.1:3128
	# export http_proxy=192.168.1.1:3128
	# port -d selfupdate
	
	or just	
	$ sudo port -d selfupdate
	
[o] Install libglade and pygtk
	$ sudo port install libglade2 py-gtk2

[o] Install X11?
       If you dont have X11 (Tiger OSX users can find it on the DVD, go to "Optional Installs)) you can download it from the Apple website:
	http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/x11formacosx.html
	Download X11User.dmg and install it 

[o] Run X11 
   Having X11 doesn't mean your GUI will change at all, it will simply open an xterm where you will be able to run the CANVAS gui.
   $ /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 &

[o] run canvas :D
 /opt/local/bin/python ./runcanvas.py
