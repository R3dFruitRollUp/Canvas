(review on Amazon by Andres De Vivanco (Redmond, WA United States)): The title "Shellcoder's handbook" made me reluctant to even buy this book. I thought it would go about explaining exploiting stack, heap overruns, bypassing memory exploitation methods and so on in order to execute shell code: basically, a book for hacking and I didn't like that....&Hopefully, like rational and ethical software security engineers will do, this book will be used more for vulnerability discovery and benign exploitation rather than malicious exploitation.
